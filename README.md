# Smart Poultry Farm Management System (Web-Based UI)

## Overview

The **Smart Poultry Farm Management System** is a **web-based** solution aimed at poultry farmers to manage their farms efficiently through **real-time data monitoring** and **automation**. This system integrates **IoT**, **data analytics**, and **web technologies** to help farm managers track farm conditions, optimize resource usage, and make data-driven decisions for better productivity and poultry health.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Visualize live data from IoT sensors such as **temperature**, **humidity**, and **ammonia levels**.
- **Automated Control Systems:** Control **feed**, **water**, and **lighting** remotely via the web interface based on sensor data.
- **Health Monitoring & Alerts:** Receive alerts for abnormal conditions such as high temperature, humidity, or ammonia levels.
- **Data Analytics:** Generate **performance reports** and **predictive analytics** for poultry growth, feed consumption, and egg production.
- **Farm Management Dashboard:** A centralized interface to manage multiple farms, view real-time data, and generate reports.
- **Sustainability & Efficiency Tracking:** Optimize resource usage such as **water**, **energy**, and **feed consumption**.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** 
  - **React.js** (for building the UI)
  - **Chart.js** / **D3.js** (for data visualization)
  - **CSS** / **Bootstrap** (for styling and responsive design)

- **Backend:** 
  - **PHP** (for server-side logic and API)
  - **MySQL** (for database management)

- **IoT Integration:**
  - **ESP32** or **Arduino** (for connecting IoT sensors)
  - **MQTT** or **HTTP** (for sending sensor data to the server)

- **Cloud Hosting:**
  - **AWS** or **Firebase** (for cloud-based data storage)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** and **npm** installed (for React.js frontend).
2. **PHP** and **MySQL** installed (for the backend server).
3. **IoT sensors** (temperature, humidity, etc.) connected via **ESP32** or **Arduino**.
